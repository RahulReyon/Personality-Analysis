    <h1>Personality Analysis by Mobile App Usage</h1>
    <p>
      <em><strong>Personality Analysis by Mobile App Usage</strong></em> is an innovative web application designed to bridge the gap between traditional psychological assessment and modern digital behavior. This project harnesses users’ interactions with their mobile devices to provide deep insights into their personality traits, utilizing well-established frameworks such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Big Five (OCEAN) model.

    <h2>Project Concept</h2>
    <p>IInstead of relying solely on generic and context-free questions, this application dives into the patterns of mobile app usage to unearth aspects of a user’s character. By <strong>analyzing which types of apps are most frequently used</strong>—whether it's social media, productivity, entertainment, or finance—the system reveals <strong>behavioral trends</strong> that align with key personality traits.</p>
